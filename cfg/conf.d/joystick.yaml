  # Configuration settings for the joystick-teleop plugin
  # The example configuration is suitable for an Xbox 360 controller
  teleop:
    # Axes index for forward/backward, sideward, and rotational movement
    # To find out the proper axes for your joystick run:
    # jstest /dev/input/js0
    # (replace the device path with the device_file configured above)
    # Then move the axis you want to use and note and set its index here
    axis_forward:  1
    axis_sideward: 0
    axis_rotation: 3

    # Accept axis value if its absolute value is above this threshold
    axis_threshold: 0.2

    # Use a joystick axis as deadman switch. To disable this, simply
    # comment out the following line. Determine the axis the same way
    # as above, but additionally note above or below which value the
    # deadman switch should activate. If you set the threshold to a
    # negative value, the robot will only move if the axis value is
    # less than this value. If it is positive, the axis value must be
    # greater than this value.
    # Pressing any button will always allow movement.
