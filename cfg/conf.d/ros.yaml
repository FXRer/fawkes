ros:
  # Set a custom node name, for example if multiple fawkes instances
  # share the same roscore. Set to special value $HOSTNAME to use short
  # hostname. Examples:
  # node-name: tims_fawkes
  # node-name: $HOSTNAME

  # Spin the ROS main loop asynchronously from the Fawkes main loop?
  # Synchronous is preferred. But this will block the ROSNodeThread for
  # example for long running service calls (where a Fawkes plugin provides
  # the service, since it is executed in the thread).
  async-spinning: true

  # Number of threads for asynchronous spinning
  async-num-threads: 4
