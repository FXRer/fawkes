NAME
----
ffrefboxrep - Fawkes referee box repeater

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*ffrefboxrep* [-d] [-b] [-l 'league'] [-u] [-t 'team'] [-g 'goal color']
	    [-p 'port'] [-m 'addr'] [-k 'key'] [-i 'iv] ['hosts']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This tool is used in RoboCup to communicate instructions from a
referee box (refbox) to robots. It receives information from the
refbox, and processes and resends it in a way suitable for robots
running Fawkes.

It implements several different protocols for different leagues and
years. The information is send to the robot either using the Fawkes
world info protocol or using remote blackboard connections.

The refboxcomm plugin should be preferred if at all possible. It can
be used for multicast and broadcast protocols like msl2010 and spl.

OPTIONS
-------
 *-h*::
	Show usage instructions.

 *-d*::
	Turn on debug mode (prints debug info to stdout)

 *-b*::
	Use remote blackboard connections to communicate information
	to robots instead of the world info protocol. Robot host names
	must be passed as arguments after the options ('hosts').

 *-l* 'league'::
	The league whose protocol should be used. Must be one of
	msl2007, msl2008, msl2010 (mid-size league protocol of the
	respective year), or spl (Standard Platform League).

 *-u*::
	For msl2010, use unicast instead of multicast communication.

 *-g* 'goal color'::
	Specify the goal color of the own team, either blue or yellow.

 *-t* 'team'::
	Specify the color of the own team, either cyan or magenta.

 *-p* 'port'::
	Use 'port' for multi-cast communication with the own
	team. Defaults to 2806.

 *-m* 'addr'::
	Use 'addr' as the multicast address to talk to. Defaults to
	224.16.0.1.

 *-k* 'key'::
	Use 'key' for encryption in the world info protocol. Defaults
	to AllemaniACs.

 *-i* 'iv'::
	Initialization vector for encryption. Defaults to AllemaniACs.


EXAMPLES
--------
