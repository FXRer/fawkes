      This interface provides internal skiller data that should allow for
      easier debugging of skills and the skiller in general. The most notable
      feature is a graph representation in the dot language of the available
      skills (and highlighting for the currently active skill).
    </comment>
    <field type="char" length="32" name="graph_fsm">

    </field>
    <field type="char" length="8192" name="graph">
      The selected graph in a dot string representation.

      Set which graph to show. The special string "ACTIVE" (case sensitive)
      will show the currently active skill's graph (if available).
