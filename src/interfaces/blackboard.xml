    <comment>This interface gives access to BlackBoard internal data. It is used by
      management code in the BlackBoard to communicate required data. It can also be
      used to allow for debugging from the outside.</comment>
    <field type="unsigned int" name="InstanceSerial">A serial number incremented for each
    interface access instance of any type. This is not the internal memory serial which is
    incremented for every interface allocated in the shared memory! The instance serial
    allows messages to be linked with a specific sending interface instance, and not just
    with the interface block.</field>

  <message name="GetInstanceSerial">
    <comment>Returns a serial which is guaranteed to be unique throughout all access methods
    as long as BlackBoard management code is used. The reply will include just the unique
    instance serial.</comment>
